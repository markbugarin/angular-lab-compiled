# Styling Components

**_Instructions_**: The event details component is displaying information about an event, the labels
are in one div and the values are in a separate div, but the two divs are not aligned. Add styles to
the component to get the second div to show to the right of the first div. Feel free to play around
with any other styles you'd like to add.

__HINT:__ Setting the two divs to `display:inline-block` should do the trick.

To do this you will need to:

1. Add classes to the styles property of the component metadata (don't add inline styles in the template).

2. Add the classes to the divs in the template.
