# Repeating Data with ngFor

**_Instructions_**: Update the events-list component to display the events that are stored in an array
on the component. To do this you will need to:

1. Use ngFor to repeat the `<tr>` element in the `<tbody>` element in the component's template

   You will bind to the `events` array that is already defined on the component.

2. Add bindings inside the `<td>` elements to bind to the properties on each event.
